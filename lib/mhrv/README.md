# mhrv

`mhrv` is a matlab toolbox for calculating Heart-Rate Variability (HRV) metrics
from both ECG signals and RR-interval time series. The toolbox works with ECG
data in the [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) [1] WFDB data format.

## Features

- **WFDB wrappers and helpers**. A small subset of the PhysioNet WFDB tools are
  wrapped with matlab functions, to allow using them directly from matlab.
    * `gqrs` - A QRS detection algorithm.
    * `rdsamp` - For reading PhysioNet signal data into matlab.
    * `rdann` - For reading PhysioNet annotation data into matlab.
    * `wrann` - For writing PhysioNet annotation data from matlab datatypes.
    * `wfdb_header` - Read record metadata from a WFDB header file (`.hea`).

- **ECG signal processing**. Peak detection and RR interval extraction from ECG data
  in PhysioNet format.
    * `rqrs` - Detection of R-peaks in ECG signals (based on PhysioNet's
      `gqrs`). Configurable for use with both human and animal ECGs.
    * `jqrs`/`wjqrs` - An ECG peak-detector based on a modified Pan & Tompkins
      algorithm and a windowed version.
    * `bpfilt`- Bandpass filtering for removing noise artifacts from ECG
      signals.
    * `ecgrr` - Construction of RR intervals from ECG data in PhysioNet format.
    * `qrs_compare` - Comparison of QRS detections to reference annotations and
      calculation of quality measures like Sensitivity, PPV.

- **RR-intervals signal processing**. Ectopic beat rejection, frequency filtering,
  nonlinear dynamic and fractal analysis.
    * `filtrr` - Filtering of RR interval time series to detect ectopic (out of
      place) beats.
    * `dfa` - Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, a method of estimating the fractal
      scaling exponent of a signal [3].
    * `mse` - Multiscale Sample Entropy, a measure of the complexity of the
      signal computed on multiple time scales [4].
    * `sample_entropy` - Sample Entropy, a measure of the irregularity of a signal.

* HRV Metrics: Calculating quantitative measures that indicate the activity of
    the heart based on RR intervals using all standard HRV metrics defined in
    the literature (see e.g. [2]).
    * `hrv_time` - Time Domain: AVNN, SDNN, RMSSD, pNNx.
    * `hrv_freq` - Frequency Domain:
        * Total and normalized power in (configurable) VLF, LF, HF and custom
          user-defined bands.
        * Spectral power estimation using Lomb, Auto Regressive, Welch and FFT methods.
        * Additional frequency-domain features: LF/HF ratio, LF and HF peak
          frequencies, power-law scaling exponent (beta).
    * `hrv_nonlinear` - Nonlinear methods:
        * Short- and long-term scaling exponents (alpha1, alpha2) based on DFA.
        * Sample Entropy and Multiscale sample entropy (MSE).
        * PoincarÃ© plot metrics (SD1, SD2).
    * `hrv_fragmentation` - Time-domain RR interval fragmentation analysis [5].

* Configuration: The toolbox is fully configurable with many user-adjustable
  parameters.
    * The configuration files are in human-readable YAML format which
      is easy to edit and extend.
    * The user can create custom configurations files based on the
      `defatuls.yml` file (only overriding what's required).
    * Custom configuration files can be loaded with a single call which updates
      the defaults for the entire toolbox. This allows simple, reproducible
      analysis of different datasets that require different analysis
      configurations.
    * The settings for any of the functions can either be configured globally
      with configuration `yml` files or on a per-call basis with matlab-style
      key-value argument pairs.

* Plotting: All toolbox functions support plotting their output for data
  visualization. The plotting code is separated from the algorithmic code in
  order to simplify embedding this toolbox in other matlab applications.

* Top-level analysis functions: These functions work with PhysioNet records and
  allow streamlined HRV analysis by composing the functions of this toolbox.
    * `mhrv` - Analyzes a single PhysioNet record (ECG data or annotations),
      optionally split into multiple analysis windows.  Extracts all
      supported HRV features and optionally generates plots.
    * `mhrv_batch` - Analyzes many PhysioNet records (ECG data or annotations) which
      can be further separated into user-defined groups (e.g. Control, Test).
      Automatically computes HRV metrics per group and generates a comparative
      summary of the HRV features in each group.

## Requirements

* Matlab with Signal Processing toolbox. Should work on Matlab R2014b or newer.
* The [PhysioNet WFDB tools](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml).
  The toolbox can install this for you.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo or download the source code.

2. From MATLAB, run the `mhrv_init` function. This function will:

    * Check for the presence of the WFDB tools in your system `PATH`. If WFDB
      tools are not detected, it will attempt to automatically download them for
      you into the folder `bin/wfdb` under the repository root.
    * Set up your MATLAB path to include the code from this toolbox.

### Manual WFDB Installation (Optional)

The above steps should be enough to get most users started. If however you
don't want `mhrv_init` to download the WFDB tools for you, or the automatic
installation fails for some reason, you can install them yourself.

  * On OSX, you can use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install it easily with
      `brew install wfdb`.
  * On Windows and Linux, you should either [download the WFDB
      binaries](https://physionet.org/physiotools/binaries/)
      for your OS or compile them [from
      source](https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml#downloading)
      using the instructions on their website.

Once you have the binaries, place them in some folder on your `$PATH` or
somewere under the repo's root folder (`bin/wfdb` would be a good choice as it's
`.gitignore`d) and they will be found and used automatically. Or, if you would
like to manually specify a path outside the repo which contains the WFDB
binaries (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` for a homebrew install), you can edit
[`cfg/defaults.yml`](https://github.com/avivrosenberg/mhrv/blob/master/cfg/defaults.yml)
and set the `mhrv.paths.wfdb_path` variable to the desired path.

For linux users it's recommended to install from source as the binaries provided
on the PhysioNet website are very outdated.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on
[readthedocs](https://mhrv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage
Exaple of calculating HRV measures for a PhysioNet record downloaded from
PhysioNet (in this case from
[`mitdb`](https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/)):

```matlab
% Download the mitdb/111 record from PhysioNet to local folder named 'db'
>> download_wfdb_records('mitdb', '111', 'db');

% Run HRV analysis
>> mhrv('db/mitdb/111', 'window_minutes', 15, 'plot', true);
```

Will give you:

```

The `window_minutes` parameter allow splitting the signal into windows and
calculating all metrics per window. You can pass in an empty array `[]` to
disable spliting.

## Citing

This toolbox, initially called `rhrv`, was created as part of my MSc research
thesis. It was then renamed and updated to be used  as the basis of the
[PhysioZoo](https://physiozoo.github.io) platform for HRV analysis of human and
animal data.
